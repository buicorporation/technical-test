# Buicorporation's take-home test for SWE (Software Engineer)

Our stack is essentially based on Dart, Typescript, Postgres for the database and Redis for the cache.
The architecture used is DDH (Domain Driven Hexagonal).

# API

For the API, you'll use the `NestJS` framework.

However, you can use the **framework** or **language** that suits you best.

### Nestjs Structure    

```
.
├── core/
│   ├── application
│   └── domain
├── infrastructure
└── interface
```

### Docker

You need to **dockerize** the project, by creating these two files `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`

### Expected Endpoint

You are expected to implement at least one endpoint, `/transactions` that accepts HTTP `POST`, `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests from the client. You are free to choose the body and headers of that endpoint.

### README File

You need to update `README` file with instructions on how to use your program. Think of it as scratchboard. 
You are highly encouraged to discuss your approach, mention pitfalls you have seen but not fixed, alternative approaches that you may have discarded and for what reason.

### Documentation

Sequence diagrams are encouraged to describe your chosen approach, other than that you are welcomed to document your code as you would have done under normal circumstances.

### Configuration

Replace `NestJS` express to **fastify** and configure **compression**

### Approach

The use of `CQRS` is a plus in this exercise

***

# Client

You'll use the `NextJS` framework.
The client application is for internal use only. 
You must use a `clean architecture` for this exercise.

### Docker

You need to **dockerize** the project, by creating these two files `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`

### Library

use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

***

# Mobile

### Flutter Structure

For the Mobile, you'll use the `Flutter` framework

### Flutter Structure

```
.
├── core/
│   ├── application
│   └── domain
├── infrastructure
└── interface
```

### Dependencies

- Get it
- BLoc
- Hive
- Equatable
- Auto route
- Dio

### Expected

Your application must be able to list and update transactions. 
We want you to know that the mobile application is intended for simple consumers.

***

## Bonus

- Test writing is strongly encouraged (Unit, acceptance).
- Setting up an authentication system for each project
- The installation of caches is highly recommended.

**NB: There may be a trap.**
